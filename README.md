# python-survey

A small survey web-app created using Flask and PostgreSql database. The app mainly takes as input a unique email , a unique 
user name and a measure between 50 and 100 of how much he likes python. The survey calculates the average over all people who 
appeared in the survey and displays the results. The uniqueness of the records ( meaning the unique email and user names ) was
maintained using the postgresql database.
